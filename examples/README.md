# Flax Examples

This folder contains a collection of examples of implementations of various architectures and training procedures.

Each examples is designed to be self-contained and easily forkable, while reproducing "key results" in different areas of machine learning. Official Flax examples come with significant maintenance expectations, including:
* Tested benchmarks on single-GPU, multi-GPU, and TPU configurations (XCXC see examples/imagenet/README as an example)
* Unit tests (e.g. that one training step succeeds)
* Adherence to Flax best practices and code updates as those best practices evolve
* An "owner" who is a member of the Flax core team that keeps the example up-to-date
* A minimal implementation that implements a single model on a single dataset -- if users
  want to configure them differently, they can fork the example.

In addition to the curated list of official Flax examples, there is a growing community
of people using Flax to build new types of machine learning models. We are happy
to showcase ... xcxc models ... 

NOTE: If you have an idea for an example, please file an issue first!

We can have an open discussion on the issue as to whether it makes sense to add your example to the main Flax 
repository. We try to keep this list of examples relatively contained.

Please be aware that if you send us large Pull Requests without discussing them first, we may not review them.
